I'm a Bachelor of Geodetic Engineering graduate from Universitas Gadjah Mada, currently pursuing my Master's degree in Geomatics Engineering, specializing in Geoinformatics, at the same university. My current focus is on my master's thesis project, where I'm exploring the use of AR technology for 3D visualization of land and spatial information in Yogyakarta city.

Recently, I've reignited my activity on GitHub and am excited to regularly update my repository. While I've dabbled in various courses and projects, many of them have yet to be properly documented. I'm now committed to organizing and sharing my work on GitHub.

My main interests revolve around Data Science and Web Development, but I'm always eager to explore new fields. It's worth noting that my Master's thesis project diverges from these areas, as it focuses on the development of Android mobile apps using Google ARCore and Unity3D. I see myself as a generalist with a passion for learning diverse skills, although I understand the importance of specializing. Therefore, I've decided to channel my efforts into mastering Data Science and Web Development.
